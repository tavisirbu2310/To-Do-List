A one page React app for to-do lists. Firebase was used to store the data so that when somebody adds a to-do item, it will stay in the list after refreshing 
the page.
Also when an item is updated, for example it's marked as completed, it will update on the server too, so that it stays like that when the page reloads. 
Same logic goes for deleting an item as well.
I used SCSS for styling and React Hooks for an all functional components experience.

To run it:

1.Clone

2.Run npm install

3.Run npm start
